# Your rule content
When developing code for the Client keep in mind we are using Typescript and Phaser. 
Avoid using DOM manipulation or React for visuals. Use Phaser.
For server we are using SpacetimeDB in C#
The client code for communicating with the server will be done via autobindings that must be generated
by a command before they are available to the client. So the order is:
Change C# spacetime server code
Build it
Generate the autogen typescript bindings
Update the client typescript.

Do NOT start the server yourself. I already have it running.
You may build and publish the server, 
You may build the autobindings
You may build client
do not RUN the client

When you want to test if something is working on the server or cient by checking logs,
please ask me to test for you and report back.

- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to
